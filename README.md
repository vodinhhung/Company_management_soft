This is my first project in university I have done it with the help of my classmate.
It's not quite too hard, but we have tried our best to fix all bugs and finished it before deadline.

Thanks for reading this and warmly welcome any contructive comments form anybody!
By the way, I'm Hung, student of Ha Noi University of Science and Technology, one of the best technology universities in Viet Nam.
